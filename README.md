<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aurora</h1>

<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=aurorasmiles" alt="aurorasmiles" /> </p>
You might know me from various Minecraft Discords! 
I usually work on the following stuff:

[FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit/) - a high performance Fork of WorldEdit.
I usually help with supporting and moderating the Discord and GitHub issues, but I also fix some issues now and then

[BungeePerms](https://github.com/weaondara/BungeePerms) - a permissions plugin for BungeeCord/Velocity and Spigot/PaperSpigot.
I maintain BungeePerms together with my partner, who created BungeePerms in the first place

[PaperMC](https://github.com/papermc) - a Minecraft Software organization focusing on improving the Minecraft ecosystem with faster and more secure software.
I'm part of the moderation team on the [PaperMC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/papermc) and part of the Triage team on GitHub

If you would like to support my work, I'd be more than grateful if you sponsor me on GitHub.
For any questions, please feel free to contact me on Discord: aurora#4484
