<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aurora</h1>

<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=aurorasmiles" alt="aurorasmiles" /> </p>
You might know me from various Discords! 
I used to work on a lot of Minecraft stuff in the past, but I pretty much left that behind now.

I'm also part of the [Queer Lexikon e.V.](https://queer-lexikon.net/), one of germanys biggest nonprofits for queer kids and youth.

If you would like to support my work, I'd be more than grateful if you sponsor me on GitHub.
For any questions, please feel free to [contact me](https://auri.gay).
